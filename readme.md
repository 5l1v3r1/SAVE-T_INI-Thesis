# Scalable Automated Vulnerability scanning & Exploitation Tool
## SAVE-T

This work was done by Jarrett Booz as part of a Master's Thesis project at Carnegie Mellon University Information Networking Institute.  

This work is comprised of additions to the CALDERA tool that is released by MITRE [here](https://github.com/mitre/caldera). SAVE-T is built off of [CALDERA version 2.3.2](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/releases/tag/2.3.2)

SAVE-T adds exploitation abilities, fingerprinting abilties which enhance performance, and several other changes to the CALDERA tool in accordance with the goals and contributions set forth in the thesis document. 

This repo contains two directories: 

Experiment Reports -- this directory contains the JSON reports of many of the operations that were run during development and all of the reports of operations that were performed as part of the thesis evaluation. 

SAVE-T -- this directory contains the SAVE-T code. This code includes code from CALDERA and code that is unique to SAVE-T.
